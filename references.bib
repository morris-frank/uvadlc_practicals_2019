  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03067},
  abstract = {Discovering social relations in images can make machines better interpret the behavior of human beings. However, automatically recognizing social relations in images is a challenging task due to the significant gap between the domains of visual content and social relation. Existing studies separately process various features such as faces expressions, body appearance, and contextual objects, thus they cannot comprehensively capture the multi-granularity semantics, such as scenes, regional cues of persons, and interactions among persons and objects. To bridge the domain gap, we propose a Multi-Granularity Reasoning framework for social relation recognition from images. The global knowledge and mid-level details are learned from the whole scene and the regions of persons and objects, respectively. Most importantly, we explore the fine-granularity pose keypoints of persons to discover the interactions among persons and objects. Specifically, the pose-guided Person-Object Graph and Person-Pose Graph are proposed to model the actions from persons to object and the interactions between paired persons, respectively. Based on the graphs, social relation reasoning is performed by graph convolutional networks. Finally, the global features and reasoned knowledge are integrated as a comprehensive representation for social relation recognition. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Stock prediction aims to predict the future trends of a stock in order to help investors make good investment decisions. Traditional solutions for stock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a promising choice for stock prediction. However, most existing deep learning solutions are not optimized toward the target of investment, i.e., selecting the best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trends) or a regression problem (to predict stock prices). More importantly, they largely treat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich relations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same sector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered. In this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational Stock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing solutions in two major aspects: (1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock ranking, and (2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal evolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform back-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average return ratio of 98\% and 71\% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.},

  abstract = {Graphs are widely used as a natural framework that captures interactions between individual elements represented as nodes in a graph. In medical applications, specifically, nodes can represent individuals within a potentially large population (patients or healthy controls) accompanied by a set of features, while the graph edges incorporate associations between subjects in an intuitive manner. This representation allows to incorporate the wealth of imaging and non-imaging information as well as individual subject features simultaneously in disease classification tasks. Previous graph-based approaches for supervised or unsupervised learning in the context of disease prediction solely focus on pairwise similarities between subjects, disregarding individual characteristics and features, or rather rely on subject-specific imaging feature vectors and fail to model interactions between them. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of a generic framework that leverages both imaging and non-imaging information and can be used for brain analysis in large populations. This framework exploits Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and involves representing populations as a sparse graph, where its nodes are associated with imaging-based feature vectors, while phenotypic information is integrated as edge weights. The extensive evaluation explores the effect of each individual component of this framework on disease prediction performance and further compares it to different baselines. The framework performance is tested on two large datasets with diverse underlying data, ABIDE and ADNI, for the prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder and conversion to Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Our analysis shows that our novel framework can improve over state-of-the-art results on both databases, with 70.4\% classification accuracy for ABIDE and 80.0\% for ADNI.},

First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94\% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26\% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66\%). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass human-level performance (5.1\%, Russakovsky et al.) on this visual recognition challenge.},

Modeling physics system, learning molecular ﬁngerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require that a model learns from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difﬁcult to train for a ﬁxed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.},

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7–12. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13–18, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},
